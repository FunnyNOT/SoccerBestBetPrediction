## Description

This project was developed as part of a university course.
This project aims to predict the best bets for soccer matches using Kaggle's dataset. The dataset can be found [https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer).


## Script description
The project follows the following steps:

1. Cleaning the dataset: We start by handling missing values in the input data.
2. Analysis of betting companies: We analyze the information provided by different betting companies and apply Mean Squared Error and Least Squares to determine the company with the minimum error.
3. Converting returns to odds: We convert the returns given by each company for different outcomes into odds.
4. Feature extraction: We extract relevant features from the dataset.
5. Data splitting: The data is divided into train and test sets.
6. Model selection: Different models are applied to the data.
7. Cross-validation: 10-fold cross-validation is performed to evaluate the models.
8. Choosing the best model: The model with the highest accuracy percentage is selected.
